          <p>Since education at elementary school and junior high school is compulsory for Japanese nationals,
            households with a child who starts school in the coming April receive a notice regarding school
            enrollment from the municipal office (city hall) of their area of residence by the end of January.
            After receiving the notice, they should begin necessary preparation for enrollment according to the
            notice. Non-Japanese nationals living in Japan may not always receive this notice, however, since
            they are not subject to Japanese compulsory education.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-sm-6 center-vertical center-horizontal">
          <p> If you are a foreign resident and wish to have your child educated at a Japanese public school,
            you need to apply for permission to enroll your child. If you make an application for permission
            in advance, you should receive the above notice so that you can take it along with the child's
            resident card to the municipal office as part of the necessary paperwork. Public compulsory
            schools require no tuition fees in principle. Additional expenses such as lunch money may,
            however, be necessary.</p>

              <li>- Irrespective of nationality, several public junior high schools offer evening classes
                for persons aged 16 or older who live or work in Tokyo. Such classes are designed to cater
                to both persons who were unable to graduate from institutions such as elementary or junior
                high school in their home country, as well as individuals whose circumstances prevented
                them from receiving a sufficient junior high school education. In undertaking these classes,
                there is little need for individuals to worry about matters such as academic ability or
                sundry expenses, etc.</li>

          <p>Junior high school graduates may continue their education to high school or Technological
            colleges (kosen), which, however, is not compulsory and therefore requires the passing of
            an admission exam to enter. High schools generally offer a three-year program, while evening
            high schools and correspondence courses offer programs that are of a longer duration.
            There are several types of high schools.</p>

              <li>- Technological colleges (kosen) </li>
              <li>- Combined with college-level education, technological colleges in Japan offer a five-year program to students who wish to gain greater technology-related skills. The specialized areas of technological colleges include industry, merchant marine-related studies, electronic/information engineering and aviation (At present, there are no technological colleges in Tokyo for merchant marine-related studies or electronic/information engineering). Graduates of technological colleges   go directly into employment or continue their education at university.</li>
              <li>- Evening classes/correspondence courses</li>
              <li>- Some high schools offer evening classes or home correspondence courses for those who work during the daytime and vice versa, and wish to receive a high school diploma. The classes and courses allow once-truant students and dropouts to learn at his/her own pace.</li>
              <li>- High school graduates are entitled to take admission exams to junior colleges and universities.</li>
              <li>- Those who do not hold a high school diploma need to take and pass a qualification test (commonly known as daiken) to be eligible for universities' admission exams.</li>
              <li>- Junior colleges offer a two-year program, while universities offer a four-year program. Junior college/technology college graduates may transfer to a four-year university course as a junior student. University graduates who wish to further study in their specialized area may choose to continue their education to graduate school. Master's programs offered at graduate schools are usually a two-year course.</li>

         <p>Specialized in Japanese language education, these Japanese language schools offer various courses
           for students whose goal is to enter Japanese universities and colleges. The classes are usually
           held for 4 to 5 hours a day or 20 to 25 hours a week. Many students study Japanese for 1 to 2 years
           at these language schools before they are admitted to the target university.</p>

          <p>Japanese classes and lessons are mostly offered by municipal offices, international exchange associations,
            and volunteer groups in the community and are available for reasonable fees or often free of charge. They
            are usually held once or twice a week at local public facilities or local school's classrooms. Another
            benefit of taking these community-based Japanese classes is that since they are mostly operated by local
            volunteers, thus participants in the class are also given an opportunity to meet other residents in the
            community and gain helpful information for their daily life. Classes may be available for adults, children,
            or families, and can be participated in as a group or individually.</p>

          <p>The following language examinations evaluate the proficiency of Japanese language for those whose native
            language is not Japanese. Taking these tests can be helpful to know your skill level and set the next goal
            of your study. If you are considering attending school or finding a job, the test results can also serve
            as proof of your current Japanese language skill level.</p>
